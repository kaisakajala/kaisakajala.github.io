    <p>My research focus is understanding how different plant cell types have evolved, and how they develop and respond to environmental cues.</p><p>Plants are the primary source of energy for the humankind, and they do an incredible job growing come rain or shine. As they are rooted to the ground and unable to escape the challenges they face, they have evolved a remarkable capacity to modulate their growth and development in response to the environment. This phenotypic plasticity is controlled by tightly regulated changes to gene expression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of how different plant tissues and plant cell types respond to environmental challenges, such as drought, flooding and light, will allow us to tap into uncharted potential for breeding smarter and more resilient crops.</p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Exodermis</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Exodermis is a root cell type located just under the epidermis, the outermost skin of the root, and it protects the root from drying and drowning. The water- and air-proofing capabilities of exodermis are brought about by two hydrophobic additions to the cell walls: 1) a localized lignin band called Casparian strip that divides the layer to two polarities, inside and outside, and 2) suberin lamellae deposited all around the exodermal cells.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">These barriers work in various ways in protecting the root. In drought, the exodermis allows the plants to have higher water retention in drought conditions, making them more drought-tolerant. In flooding, the exodermis prevents oxygen loss from the roots into the soil, leading to more oxygen for root respiration and better flooding tolerance. In saline soils, the exodermis allows increased control of ion and salt uptake from the soil, enhancing salinity tolerance.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Not all plants have exodermis, but all vascular plants have a cell layer called endodermis. Endodermis has both the Casparian strip and the suberin lamella, and the development of endodermis has been elucidated well on the molecular level in the model plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> that happens to lack the exodermis<em>.</em> The endodermis appears evolutionarily more ancient, but the presence of exodermis in many crop plants and the evolutionary origins of exodermis remain un-elucidated. Did exodermis evolve by co-opting modules of endodermal development to a new cell layer? What regulates these modules in exodermis? How are the environmental cues integrated with the exodermal development? These are some of the questions that I hope to answer using tomato roots as my model system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>My previous research</strong></p><p>I carried out my PhD research in the Hibberd lab at University of Cambridge. I investigated the evolution of the elements that directed cell type-specific gene expression in mesophyll cells in the leaves of C4 plant <em>Cleome gynandra</em>.</p><p>For my postdoctoral work I joined the Brady lab at University of California, Davis, where I have been generating an <strong><em>atlas of tomato root gene expression</em></strong><em>. </em>This atlas encompasses combinations of a dozen root cell and tissue types, multiple levels of regulation (chromatin accessibility, nuclear transcriptome, translatome) and different growth conditions (e.g. drought, flooding, plate, soil) for a domesticated tomato <em>Solanum lycopesicum</em> as well as a wild drought-tolerant relative <em>Solanum pennellii</em>. Combining the functional genomics data with stress-responsive cell development phenotypes sheds light onto molecular mechanisms underlying the plasticity of development on cellular level.</p>
